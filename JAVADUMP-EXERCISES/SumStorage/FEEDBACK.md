The code demonstrates good understanding of classes, objects, and basic OOP principles. The project structure is logical and the functionality works as intended. Good work!

**OVERALL: PASSED**

Minor Tweaks:

* Methods should be `private` instead of package-private (default access) when they're only used in the same class.
  ```java
  // Current
  static void displayMenu(boolean isFull) {
  
  // Better
  private static void displayMenu(boolean isFull) {
  ```

* State management: It's a small thing, but logically I would start lockers as available, so I would change the locker constructor to not include the pin:
  ```java
  // Current constructor allows any PIN
  public Locker(int number, String pin) {
  
  // Better - lockers start available
  public Locker(int number) {
      this.number = number;
      this.pin = null; // Always start available
  }
  ```

  This would prevent you from having to pass a `null` value every time from the service.
  ```java
  new Locker(i, null);
  ```

* `releaseLocker(int number, String pin)` method exists but isn't used - remove it or use it!
