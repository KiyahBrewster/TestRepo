This project involved translating design requirements into a functional Java console application to simulate a storage locker access system. The main functionality—renting lockers, PIN-based access, and releasing lockers—was successfully implemented and tested using clean object-oriented practices.

The design was implemented with modularity in mind. By introducing the Locker class to encapsulate locker behavior and a LockerService to manage business logic, the code remained maintainable and easier to test. TerminalUtils handled repetitive user interaction tasks, further promoting DRY principles.

Throughout the development process, key lessons included:

The importance of isolating logic into well-defined classes and methods.

The benefit of early prototyping to catch logic errors before scaling.

How to use input validation and confirmation dialogs to protect against misuse.

This assignment provides a solid foundation for expansion in future iterations, such as adding authentication, data persistence, or graphical interfaces.
